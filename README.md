# The Year in Commits

2014 GitHub commits leader board

## What is The Year In Commits?

We were playing with the [github-commits](https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-commits)
library to pull some year-end statistics at npm, which gave me the idea to throw this little app together.

* it's a leader board that counts commits to your personal GitHub projects.
* it was a fun little hacking project, i.e., don't take it seriously:
  * the quantity of commits does not reflect on the quality of commits.
  * It only looks at your personal projects.
